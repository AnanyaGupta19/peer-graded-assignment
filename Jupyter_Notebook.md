# Data Science Languages

- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Scala
- MATLAB
- Java
- C++
- SAS
- Perl
- Go
- Ruby
- Haskell
- Swift

These are some of the popular programming languages used in data science and analytics. Each language has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of language often depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the data scientist or analyst.


## Data Science Libraries

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch
- SciPy
- Statsmodels
- NLTK
- OpenCV
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

These are some of the popular data science libraries used in various stages of the data analysis and machine learning workflow. Each library provides a range of functions and tools to handle data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning tasks.

## Data Science Tools

| Tool          | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Python        | General-purpose programming language       |
| R             | Statistical computing and graphics         |
| SQL           | Database querying and manipulation         |
| Tableau       | Data visualization and business intelligence |
| TensorFlow    | Machine learning and deep learning library |
| PyTorch       | Deep learning framework                    |
| Apache Spark  | Big data processing and analytics


## Arithmetic Expression Examples

Here are some examples of arithmetic expressions:

1. Addition: 2 + 3 = 5
2. Subtraction: 6 - 4 = 2
3. Multiplication: 5 * 7 = 35
4. Division: 10 / 2 = 5
5. Exponentiation: 2 ** 3 = 8
6. Modulo: 11 % 4 = 3

Arithmetic expressions involve mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo. These operations can be used to perform calculations and manipulate numerical data in programming and mathematics.



```python
# Multiply and Add Numbers

# Multiply two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 7
product = num1 * num2

print("Product:", product)

# Add two numbers
num3 = 10
num4 = 3
sum = num3 + num4

print("Sum:", sum)

```

    Product: 35
    Sum: 13



```python
# Convert Minutes to Hours

minutes = 135

# Calculate the number of hours
hours = minutes / 60

print("Minutes:", minutes)
print("Hours:", hours)

```

    Minutes: 135
    Hours: 2.25
